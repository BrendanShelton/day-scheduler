# day-scheduler
A website which allows the user to record a day's schedule
## Description

This application displays eight time blocks for the hours in a work day and uses Javascript, jQuery, and Moment.js to change their backgound colors to show which hours are past, present, and future. The user can enter text into each block and save it to the local storage. The current date is displayed at the top under the heading.
